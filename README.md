# railway-reservation-system

Railway Ticket Reservation is an application that enables users to book their tickets of railway online this application also provides numerous facilities through which it becomes easier for a person to book their ticket online such as E-TICKET which enables user to get the conformation through online mode in the form of SMS" or "CONFORMATION" message tagline during the booking process. This application is more helpful for those who don't get too much time from their hectic schedule.
C++ is superfast, and is a general purpose programming language that supports both procedure and object oriented programming making it very flexible. If more professional companies are using C++, it stands to reason that there is going to be more of a demand for C++ programmers But the main reason many should probably leam C is because it is so powerful! There are many, many leading software titles wrinen entirely or partly in C++ These include the Windows, Linux and Mac OSX operating systems! Many of the Adobe products such as Photoshop and Illustration, the my SQL, and MonuoDB database engines, and many many more are written in C++ We are using C++ in this project.
This project is simple to understand and can be used by anyone who is not even familiar with the railway reservation. It is user friendly and user has to follow step by step operations which is very easy process and this project also heips by giving him few options. It performa many of the operations of the railway company
SYSTEM SPECIFICATIONS
Software engineers also do things in addition to writing code: they generate software ideas, they work with stakeholders to understand requirements, they test and maintain the final product and they co-ordinate the entire software development process They are used in all stages of software development process, namely, planning, analysis, design, development and maintenance. The software development procedure integrates the methods and tools together and enables rational and timely development of the software system
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION

1 . At first list, all the modules of a Railway Ticket Reservation system requires to run smoothly Railway reservation systein must have these following modules
i.      Book ticket module
ii.     Check PNR module
iii.    Railway timings module
iv.    Rail location module
2. Construct a data flow diagram for each module While making data flow diagram consider the interrelationship between modules
 3. Now comes designing the system. In this step, you have to design the user interface and database for the management system While designing the database ise various normalization techniques to eliminate data redundancy
i.    Database connection
ii.  Railway maintenance (order a food, PNR status, ticker availability update ticket details etc.)
iii.   Confirmed e-ticker
iv.   Ticket details for conformation
v.    User login and logout etc.
Project Brief This project will give you a brief idea of how a Railway Ticket Reservation works You will understand how this software is developed
